###This week you will:

0. Track and report your "billable hours" - the time you actually spend on performing PCS learning activities. Do not report any time you spend learning related topics, using related sources, or spending time with other coders that you do not use to work on class work. You should include the time you spend at Tuesday's meetup and Friday's happy hour, be cause those are required and/or recommended by PCS. Report for the period of Monday through Monday.

0. Do a [self-assessment](self-assessment01.md) by yourself outside of class

0. Discuss self-assessment topics as a group on Saturday to check your progress

0. Start the following [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com)

	0. Start at the [web site](http://rubykoans.com) and read the introductory material
	0. Go to [Ruby Koans Online](http://koans.heroku.com/en) and read the introductory material and try out a few koans.
	0. Clone the [github repo](https://github.com/neo/ruby_koans) to your local machine and do the first few.
	0. "Time box" your effort to no more than 2 or 3 hours. Once you have the repo cloned, stop doing koans when you run out of time.
	0. Feel free to work with classmates, but everybody needs to end up with their own repo where I can see your individual progress

0. Finish all of the [Ruby Foundations Deep Dive](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/ruby-foundations) screencasts on Treehouse. 

0. Read and watch the topic information you will need for the code challenge (See below)
