# Notes on Pair Programming

Pair programming is a technique for two people to collaboratively develop code.

From Cris' presentation:

Pair Programming is
* an agile software development technique
* two people sitting at one work station
* as productive as two devs working separately
* a social skill that takes time to develop
* a time to say “Let’s try your idea first”
* two devs focusing on one problem
* a skill valued by employers

Pair Programming *is not*
* mentoring 
* comfortable at first
* a time to think about what’s for dinner
* a place for egotism
* an all day activity
* the time to “do your own thing”

Benefits
* Shorter programs, better designs, fewer bugs
* More alternatives are considered
* Problems don’t feel “impossible”
* Knowledge passes between coworkers
* New hires pick up company practices quicker
* Improved discipline and time management
* Increased morale, higher confidence in your code

Types of pairs:

Driver/Observer

Driver: does the thinking and the typing
OBSERVER: observes, checks, feedback

Experienced
